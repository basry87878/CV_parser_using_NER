I always wanted to be a\\ndetective which was inspired by one of my favourite films. But\\nthe fortune took me to another way, to the journey of Information\\nTechnology. I have completed my Diploma in Engineering in IT in\\n2014 A.D. and Bachelor Honors in IT in 2018 A.D. I started working\\nas a software developer in 2017 and currently working at Ekbana\\nSolution.  \\nSince childhood, I was very open minded and was less\\noverprotected by parents. I still remember roaming the whole day\\nwith friends when i was 5-6 years old. I guess other children wouldn’t\\ngo out without the permission of their parents. Because of this I\\ngot huge opportunities to learn and earn people beyond my school\\nfriends. I was one of the active students in school like engaging in\\ndancing, sports, and other curriculum activities. Since childhood\\nI always go on evening walks which makes me feel fresh and\\nhappening...\\nThough I love exploring and social life, I am really shy in nature and\\nless talkative. I always wanted a break after some periods of working\\nlife. A phase of my life came  where I was able to manage my travel\\ncost, and the desire of exploring new places, love towards nature led\\nme to trek and travel to different parts of Nepal. I began to travel 3\\ntimes a year taking a break from work and study. And I will keep on\\ntraveling till my legs are with me.  \\nBeyond study, travel, family and work, I am a social worker as well.\\nIt’s been more than 7 years contributing my time and effort for the\\nsake of community, peace and humanity through the Rotaract Club\\nof Bhaktapur. Rotaract has really brought a big positive effect in my\\nlife. It gave me opportunities to utilize my spare time for good things,\\nearned me a huge group of nice people, taught me to become a\\nleader, taught me to learn from failure and success. It really helped\\n\\xa0 Page 1 of 3\\xa0 \\xa0\\nmy life to be surrounded by positive energies. I am always committed\\nto all aspects of my life and I believe life is better when all these\\nthings are balanced. \\nAnyways thanks for visiting my profile, visit my website\\nwww.rabigorkhai.com.np and hope may be you will find some\\ninformation you needed and yeah keep in touch.\\nExperience\\nEkbana\\nSoftware Engineer (php)\\nJune 2018\\xa0-\\xa0Present\\xa0 (4 years 7 months)\\nEKbana Solutions Pte.

Some of the algorithms are\\nelegant but far from the coolest algorithms I know. And you have to\\nbe mathematically inclined to appreciate algorithms in the first place.\\nBut the things you can do with machine learning are endless. When\\npeople ask me what I do? I normally answer I predict the future.\\nWhich is entirely correct. I make concrete verifiable predictions about\\nthe future and measure myself, I usually fair pretty well.\\nMy innate interest in Artificial Intelligence began when I found myself\\nfascinated by the projects done by seniors in one of the hackathons I\\nattended. Curiosity is the first and the foremost quality which drives a\\nperson towards learning new things. My interest, passion, dedication\\nin learning AI, enabled me to acquire significant knowledge on\\nPython and mathematics behind every ML algorithm.\\nI substantiated my knowledge by opening an Instagram page and\\na website “graspcoding.com” based on AI. My prodigious appetite\\nfor guiding others started from the moment I published my first\\npython ebook on Amazon Kindle. In the meantime, I created tutorials\\non various projects and shared them on the Website as well as\\nInstagram.\\nExperience\\nFusemachines\\nMachine Learning Engineer Associate\\nAugust 2021\\xa0-\\xa0Present\\xa0 (1 year)\\nKathmandu, Bāgmatī, Nepal\\nhttps://graspcoding.com/\\nAdmin and Content Creator \\nJuly 2020\\xa0-\\xa0Present\\xa0 (2 years 1 month)\\nKathmandu, Bāgmatī, Nepal\\n\\xa0 Page 1 of 2\\xa0 \\xa0\\nGrasp Coding is the official page handle by graspcoding.com.

This workshop was the first workshop of a 4-part series\\nworkshop that was targeted to help university students across the globe learn\\nSmart Contracts Development and build on the ICE blockchain. The series\\nwas organized by the Mousebelt team in co-ordination with ICONOsphere.\\nThe two workshops I conducted during the time are listed below:\\nWorkshop: Build a Simple DEX on ICE\\n- March 25, 2022: University of Minnesota, Minnesota\\n- April 19, 2022: Combined group of students from various universities in\\nThailand\\nBlockchain Developer [R&D]\\nJanuary 2021 - March 2022 (1 year 3 months)\\nKathmandu, Bāgmatī, Nepal\\nDuring my time at Ibriz, I got the opportunity to contribute to massivelysuccessful projects like Crazy Defense Heroes (Polygon blockchain),\\nPage 1 of 2\\n\\x0cGangstabet (ICON blockchain) alongside numerous significant projects as a\\nSmart-contracts focused RnD Blockchain Engineer.\\nMy work mostly consisted of building efficient PoCs for projects built on\\ntop of the Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains ( Polygon ) and\\nnon-EVM blockchains like ICON and ICE ( An in-production Substratebased blockchain). I got to contribute by writing numerous smart contracts,\\nresearching cutting-edge developments in the field, and integrating best\\npractices for gas-optimisations, security-vulnerzbility assessments and utility\\ntools to the Smart Contracts. I'd also assist other internal teams (frontend and\\nbackend) in integrating the smart contracts with the DApp.\\nMy main takeaway from Ibriz was the extensive knowledge I obtained out of\\nbuilding blockchain projects, most notably NFTs and Games from scratch to\\nproduction alongside a talented team.\\niBriz.ai\\nBlockchain Developer\\nMay 2020 - July 2020 (3 months)\\nEducation\\nKathmandu University (KU)\\nB.Sc., Computer Science · (November 2017 - June 2022)\\nAmarsingh Higher Secondary School, Pokhara\\n+2, Science · (2015 - 2017)\\nGandaki Boarding School\\nSLC, Science · (2008 - 2015)\\nPage 2 of 2\\n\\x0c\\n\",\n",
